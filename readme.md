# siraben's Nixpkgs overlay

> Here lies pearls, oddballs, hacks, historical curiosities, strange
> loops and more, collected over the years during my internet travels,
> packaged in Nix in the hopes that they too will spark curiosity,
> fascinate, educate and inspire future hackers.

Rather than leave them to bit-rot in my computer, I decided to
preserve them for the future by writing this overlay.  If they make
their way into Nixpkgs, I'll remove them from my overlay.
